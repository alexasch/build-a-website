# Learn to code a website from scratch!
Welcome to +1 Code Queens! This repository will get you started on the path to building your very own website. Even though we are all starting from the same place, by the end of the class you will have your own unique project to show off. So let's get started!

## Start a project folder
Make a new folder anywhere on your computer and title it CodeQueens.

## Forking the project

## Let's see it in action!
Navigate to your CodeQueens folder and find the index.html file there. Double click on the file to open it in your browser. Now you should be able to see the beginnings of your very first website!
